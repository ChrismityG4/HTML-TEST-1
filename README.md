# HTML-TEST-1
This is Test 1 of recreating a well known pre-existing homepage.
This was a smooth learning curve adn is my first time experimenting with code to visually recreate a homepage.
I really enjoyed the process and seeing the end result of my work.
I hope this illustrates my ability at this introductory level of coding ussing HTML and CSS on VS STUDIO CODE.

Thanks for reading, Have a nice day!
